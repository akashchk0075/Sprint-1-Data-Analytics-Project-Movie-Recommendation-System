    "# Movie Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "**By Akash Chakraborty**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system leveraging Python and Pandas. This system combines data exploration and feature engineering to suggest movies based on their similarity to a user-selected title. The analysis integrates key movie attributes and machine learning techniques to provide tailored recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "This project utilizes four datasets containing comprehensive movie details:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Movies.csv\n",
    "- **id**: Unique identifier for each movie.\n",
    "- **title**: The title of the movie.\n",
    "- **genres**: A list of genres associated with the movie.\n",
    "- **language**: The primary language of the movie.\n",
    "- **user_score**: The average user rating for the movie.\n",
    "- **runtime_hour**: The runtime of the movie in hours.\n",
    "- **runtime_min**: The runtime of the movie in minutes.\n",
    "- **release_date**: The release date of the movie.\n",

    "- **id**: Unique identifier corresponding to FilmDetails.\n",
    "- **runtime**: Total runtime formatted as \"Xh Ym\".\n",
    "- **budget**: Budget formatted with a dollar sign (e.g., \"$20,000,000\").\n",
    "- **revenue**: Revenue formatted with a dollar sign (e.g., \"$28,341,469\").\n",
    "- **film_id**: Foreign key linking back to FilmDetails table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PosterPath.csv\n",
    "- **id**: Unique identifier corresponding to Movies.\n",
    "- **poster_path**: URL link to the movie's poster image.\n",
    "- **backdrop_path**: URL link to the movie's backdrop image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology and Tools\n",
    "Using Python as the primary programming language, this project employs various libraries for data analysis, visualization, and recommendation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn\n",
    "- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn for similarity computation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Focus\n",
    "The project focuses on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Combining datasets to create a comprehensive movie dataset.\n",
    "- Identifying key features such as genres, director, and top-billed actors for building similarity metrics.\n",
    "- Recommending movies using a similarity matrix based on cosine similarity of extracted features."
